## Analytics


# Data definition

Data is gathered on a "per day" basis (stored locally and sent to server 
the next day) or live* (real-time; needs more brainstorming).

Data consists of a user action, a start and end timestamp, and optionally
a content ID and/or content name.

Last user action is always discarded after 5 minutes of inactivity unless
the current page is a player.
